            Philosophy is considered a science but it is difficult to say, when one
            has to compare with an ordinary science, for example biology, or chemistry.
            This is a question that turns into a burning problem among the scientists
            and linguists all over the world. Can philosophy be a science? What does
            philosophy operate with? It operates with categories, which can be as wide
            and as interchangeable as one can only imagine. Ordinary science operates
            with definitions, which are quite limited in their field of research.
            Ordinary science uses terms and laws of that very science to continue the
            research, uniting with the others in very rare cases. Philosophy gets into
            the sense of every science trying to achieve results.

            It is of course, not easy, but gives credit for you if you get interested
            and somewhere, being at the social event you quote one of the famous doctors
            of philosophy and make a great impression of an educated and intelligent
            personality.
